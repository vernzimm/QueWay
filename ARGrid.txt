#Display name of this grid in QueWay
#example: gridname = Ames Reese Grid
gridname = Ames Reese Grid

#Origin coordinate number from MCosmos for start of grid
#example: homecoord = 1000
homecoord = 1000

#X-axis and Y-axis distance from home coordinate to first grid location.
#Set to 0 if the origin location is the same as first grid.
#example: homeoffx = 35
#         homeoffy = 0
homeoffx = 65
homeoffy = 35

#X-axis and Y-axis distance from one grid location to the next.
#example: gridoffx = 80
#         gridoffy = 65
gridoffx = 80
gridoffy = 65

#Number of columns (parallel to y-axis) and rows (parallel to x-axis)
#The following would give a total of 30 grid locations.
#example: numofcols = 5
#         numofrows = 6
numofcols = 5
numofrows = 6
